Description
Nava is a modern benefits brokerage. This means that we work with companies to set up benefits plans for their employees. One of our products is a benchmarking app called Palomar. Today, it is difficult for companies to find out what benefits their peer's offer and how much they pay for said benefits. Palomar seeks to expose data like this to the world so that companies can make better benefits decisions. Hence, this project seeks to have you build a mini version of Palomar.

The Task:
Given a set of companies' data in JSON format render a UI listing companies' data based on the requirements below. The dataset is publicly available on the Form 5500 Datasets page of the US Department of Labor website.

Requirements:
The cards containing company data should be centered on the page
Each card should display the company name, company state, plan year, and employee count
Clicking "More details" should display premium sum, broker commission, and number of participants
